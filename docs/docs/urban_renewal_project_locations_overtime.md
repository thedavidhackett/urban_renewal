# Urban Renewal Project Locations in Chicago over Time

Below is a map showing the location of Urban Renewal Projects in Chicago overtime based on photos from the [Chicago Public Library's collection of Urban Renewal Records](https://www.chipublib.org/chicago-department-of-urban-renewal-records-photographic-negatives-digital-collection/). Each dot represents a project which appears based on the year of the first photo associated with that project.
